## WarcraftXL

- [wxl-core](https://github.com/WarcraftXL/wxl-core), commit
  `3990e09b5f80e77351d605dcd48d76b68ab2c2bf`: GPL-3.0-or-later.
  Copyright (C) 2026 WarcraftXL.
- `runtime/appearance_redirect.c` uses the pinned core's `PluginApi.h` ABI and
  named file-I/O hook points. SDK headers are supplied from that upstream checkout;
  the local builder verifies the header hash. The extension is GPL-3.0-or-later.
- tools/patch_wow.py is a Python adaptation of the base patcher behavior,
  including the PE import layout and edits from src/patcher/PeImage.cpp,
  GlueUnlock.cpp and NamedPatchArchives.cpp. It replaces the original C++
  implementation with Python parsing, explicit exact-build checks, backup and
  command-line handling. These modifications were made in 2026.
- [wxl-modern-m2](https://github.com/WarcraftXL/wxl-modern-m2), commit
  `7845be16924a1ec8644b957f26726a73d4a8556e`: GPL-3.0-or-later.
  Copyright (C) 2026 WarcraftXL. Used as the runtime dependency and as a
  reference for model layouts and the guarded bone-budget patch. Its DLL is
  supplied separately, not included in this source repository.
- `patches/wxl-modern-m2-dip-start-index.patch` modifies that pinned upstream's
  `src/render/M2Draw.cpp`; the corresponding exact-build transformation is in
  `tools/patch_dip_start_index.py`. These GPL-3.0-or-later changes preserve the
  native index-buffer offset at the final draw call.

Modified upstream binaries remain subject to their license and source-distribution
obligations. This source repository does not include those binaries.

## wow.export

[wow.export](https://github.com/Kruithne/wow.export) 0.2.19 is an external MIT
tool. tools/wow-export-*.cjs and install_export_hook.py integrate with its
bundled internal interfaces; the upstream application is not shipped here.

## MPQ verification helpers

The narrow MPQ reader and StormLib packing helpers in `tools/mpq_format.py`
and `tools/pack_mpq.py` are adapted from wxl-equipment-textures under
GPL-3.0-or-later. StormLib is supplied separately; its classic hash/table
format is used by the independent verifier. No StormLib binary is distributed.
